# Mars Rover API Application

An application to view pictures from the various Mars API Rover cameras. The application allows for filtering by Sol day as well as camera type. The application also uses a database (MySQL) to save search preferences.

## Mars Rover API Workshop
I followed the Mars Rover API Application Using the workshop provided by Trevor Page on Proffesso titled, "Mars Rover Api Workshop". (View the tutorial at [https://proffesso.com/Mars-Rover-Api-Workshop](https://proffesso.com/Mars-Rover-Api-Workshop))

## Thoughts
I highly recommend this course for anyone looking to make a fun application using the Mars Rover API. I enjoyed that this was a full stack application.  Since I know Javascript, HTML, and CSS, I was familiar with a lot of the concepts, but I also learned a lot. The main things I got out of this tutorial were:
1. My first experience building a Java Spring Boot Application
2. Learned about the possibilities with Thymeleaf (Java template engine)
3. Getting familiar with the Mars Rover API Calls and using Postman to test these calls (I have done this before, but it was a good exercise since this API call has a lot of variables that can be manipulated (sol day, camera type, rover)

## Technology

* Java
* Thymeleaf (Java Template Engine)
* Spring Boot (Java Framework)
* JavaScript
* HTML
* MySQL

### Running the Application with Spring Tool Suite

This was my first time using Spring Tool Suite (which is an Eclipe Based IDE), which I would use to write and run the application. This IDE made some of the development a lot easier and saved time (such as generating getters and setters and imports)

## Future Developments

Future development could include: 
* Hosting this application online
* Incorporating other NASA API's
* Making some personal touches to the Front-End Design
* The user being able to "favorite" a specific image

It would also be interesting to see if I could build this project in React.
